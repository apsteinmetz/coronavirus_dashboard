I have a macabre fascination with tracking the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.  I suspect there are two reasons for this. One, by delving into the numbers I imagine I have some control over this thing.  Second, it feels like lighting a candle to show that science can reveal truth at a time when the darkness of anti-science is creeping across the land. 

The purpose of this project is, as usual, twofold.  First, to explore an interesting data science question and, second, to explore some techniques and packages in the R universe.  We will be looking at the relationship of COVID-19 cases to mortality.  What is the lag between a positive case and a death?  How does that vary among states?  How has it varied as the pandemic has progressed?

I have been thinking about how to measure mortality lags for a while now.  What prompted to do a write-up was discovering a new function in Matt Dancho's `timetk` package, `tk_augment_lags`, which makes short work of building multiple lags.  Not too long ago, managing models for multiple lags and multiple states would have been a bit messy.  The emerging "tidy models" framework using "list columns" is immensely powerful for this sort of thing.  I was almost giddy ("Nerd!") when I was able to reduce so much analysis into so few lines of code.
